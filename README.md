## The Problem
Sometimes emergency situations can happen where people may not be around the vicinity, such as in remote areas and during the odd hours of the day like beyond midnight. These situations are critical as people may be injured or infrastructure can be on fire, and there may not be people in the vicinity that can alert the SCDF and the police. 

There is a strong urgency to render help in such a situation, but when a passer-by witness the incident after some time, it could be too late to help the injured individual or to prevent further damages to the building.

## The Solution
In order to speed up emergency response in situations where passers-by may not be around the vicinity when the incidents occur, we developed the (product name) platform. The (product name) platform makes use of the cameras installed by the police under the PolCam initiative, and use the live footages from these cameras to do video analytics. Through the live footage, we want to use machine learning to detect emergency situations and alert the SCDF more quickly.
