## The Problem
Emergency situations can happen where people may not be around the vicinity, such as in remote areas or during the odd hours of the day like beyond midnight. These situations are critical as people may be injured or infrastructure can be on fire, and there may not be people in the vicinity that can alert the SCDF and the police in time.

There is a strong urgency to render help in these situations, but it could be after some time when a passer-by manages to chance upon the incident, which by then it could be too late to help the injured individual or to prevent further damages to the building.

Hence, we feel that the time lag in response time must be resolved in such circumstances in order to save lives or prevent further damage to infrastructure.

## Our Solution
In order to speed up emergency response in situations where passers-by may not be around the vicinity when the incidents occur, we developed the Accidentalyzer platform. The Accidentalyzer platform makes use of the cameras installed in public spaces, and use the live footages from these cameras to do video analytics. Through the live footage, we want to detect emergency situations and alert the SCDF more quickly.
